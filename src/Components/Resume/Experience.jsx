        I’ve gained hands-on experience in UI/UX design, frontend, and backend
        development through internships at Stelalliance and Le-Obran, as well as
        various personal projects. I’ve designed intuitive user interfaces using
        Figma, developed responsive web applications with HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        and React.js, and built robust backend systems using Node.js, Express,
        and MongoDB. My work includes projects like a Lawyer AI website, a
        mobile quiz app, and a web-based chess game with AI, all focused on
        creating user-friendly, scalable, and high-performance digital
        solutions.
