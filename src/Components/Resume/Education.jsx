        I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering
        and am in my 6th semester. Throughout my studies, I have built a solid
        foundation in programming, web development, and software engineering
        principles. My academic journey has been complemented by hands-on
        experience through internships and projects, where I have worked with
        technologies like React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. This combination of
        theoretical knowledge and practical application has equipped me with the
        skills needed to excel in the software development field.
